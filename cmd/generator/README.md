[William Shanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shanks) published a table of primes (and the periods of their reciprocals) up to 110,000.

This program prints this table to the screen. In the
first column we have a prime number, and next to it
you can see the number of periods of the reciprocal
of the given prime number.

The text file `below_110000.txt` contains
this table.
